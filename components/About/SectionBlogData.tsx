        title: " The Daileigh",
        paragraph: `
    The Daileigh’s Ashleigh Hutchinson wants her readers to build their perfect closet. She aims to help women of all ages find or create a style they love. In particular, Ashleigh wants older women to feel confident in their own style. She wants to break the assumption that some trends are suited only to a particular age group. Ashleigh’s philosophy centers around the notion that “age is only a number.”
    
    Ashleigh’s blog is full of advice for the regular woman to make better fashion choices, whether it’s “Dressing Better With the Clothes You Have” or starting a capsule wardrobe. Along with her blog posts, she has also published e-books and has even held online webinars to help people improve their fashion sense.`
